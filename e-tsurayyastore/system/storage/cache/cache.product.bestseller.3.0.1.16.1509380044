Designed specifically for the creative professional, this display provides more space for easier access to all the tools and palettes needed to edit, format and composite your work. Combine this display with a Mac Pro, MacBook Pro, or PowerMac G5 and there's no limit to what you can achieve. &lt;br&gt;\r\n\t&lt;br&gt;\r\n\t&lt;\/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Helvetica&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;The Cinema HD features an active-matrix liquid crystal display that produces flicker-free images that deliver twice the brightness, twice the sharpness and twice the contrast ratio of a typical CRT display. Unlike other flat panels, it's designed with a pure digital interface to deliver distortion-free images that never need adjusting. With over 4 million digital pixels, the display is uniquely suited for scientific and technical applications such as visualizing molecular structures or analyzing geological data. &lt;br&gt;\r\n\t&lt;br&gt;\r\n\t&lt;\/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Helvetica&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Offering accurate, brilliant color performance, the Cinema HD delivers up to 16.7 million colors across a wide gamut allowing you to see subtle nuances between colors from soft pastels to rich jewel tones. A wide viewing angle ensures uniform color from edge to edge. Apple's ColorSync technology allows you to create custom profiles to maintain consistent color onscreen and in print. The result: You can confidently use this display in all your color-critical applications. &lt;br&gt;\r\n\t&lt;br&gt;\r\n\t&lt;\/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Helvetica&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Housed in a new aluminum design, the display has a very thin bezel that enhances visual accuracy. Each display features two FireWire 400 ports and two USB 2.0 ports, making attachment of desktop peripherals, such as iSight, iPod, digital and still cameras, hard drives, printers and scanners, even more accessible and convenient. Taking advantage of the much thinner and lighter footprint of an LCD, the new displays support the VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association) mounting interface standard. Customers with the optional Cinema Display VESA Mount Adapter kit gain the flexibility to mount their display in locations most appropriate for their work environment. &lt;br&gt;\r\n\t&lt;br&gt;\r\n\t&lt;\/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Helvetica&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;The Cinema HD features a single cable design with elegant breakout for the USB 2.0, FireWire 400 and a pure digital connection using the industry standard Digital Video Interface (DVI) interface. The DVI connection allows for a direct pure-digital connection.&lt;br&gt;\r\n\t&lt;\/font&gt;&lt;\/font&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;\r\n\tFeatures:&lt;\/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tUnrivaled display

The D300 features a new 51-point autofocus system with Nikon&amp;#39;s 3D Focus Tracking feature and two new LiveView shooting modes that allow users to frame a photograph using the camera&amp;#39;s high-resolution LCD monitor. The D300 shares a similar Scene Recognition System as is found in the D3; it promises to greatly enhance the accuracy of autofocus, autoexposure, and auto white balance by recognizing the subject or scene being photographed and applying this information to the calculations for the three functions.&lt;br \/&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;br \/&gt;\r\n\t\tThe D300 reacts with lightning speed, powering up in a mere 0.13 seconds and shooting with an imperceptible 45-millisecond shutter release lag time. The D300 is capable of shooting at a rapid six frames per second and can go as fast as eight frames per second when using the optional MB-D10 multi-power battery pack. In continuous bursts, the D300 can shoot up to 100 shots at full 12.3-megapixel resolution. (NORMAL-LARGE image setting, using a SanDisk Extreme IV 1GB CompactFlash card.)&lt;br \/&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;br \/&gt;\r\n\t\tThe D300 incorporates a range of innovative technologies and features that will significantly improve the accuracy, control, and performance photographers can get from their equipment. Its new Scene Recognition System advances the use of Nikon&amp;#39;s acclaimed 1,005-segment sensor to recognize colors and light patterns that help the camera determine the subject and the type of scene being photographed before a picture is taken. This information is used to improve the accuracy of autofocus, autoexposure, and auto white balance functions in the D300. For example, the camera can track moving subjects better and by identifying them, it can also automatically select focus points faster and with greater accuracy. It can also analyze highlights and more accurately determine exposure, as well as infer light sources to deliver more accurate white balance detection.&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n&lt;!-- cpt_container_end --&gt;","meta_title":"Cam ZenPad 3S","meta_description":"","meta_keyword":"","tag":"","model":"Digital","sku":"","upc":"","ean":"","jan":"","isbn":"","mpn":"","location":"","quantity":"9997","stock_status":"In Stock","image":"catalog\/product\/26.jpg","manufacturer_id":null,"manufacturer":null,"price":"80.0000","special":"70.0000","reward":null,"points":"0","tax_class_id":"9","date_available":"2009-02-03","weight":"0.00000000","weight_class_id":"1","length":"0.00000000","width":"0.00000000","height":"0.00000000","length_class_id":"3","subtract":"1","rating":4,"reviews":"1","minimum":"1","sort_order":"0","status":"1","date_added":"2017-05-15 11:10:33","date_modified":"2017-06-05 13:53:53","viewed":"0"},"56":{"product_id":"56","name":"Acer Aspire AIO","description":"&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;\r\n\tiPhone is a revolutionary new mobile phone that allows you to make a call by simply tapping a name or number in your address book, a favorites list, or a call log.

The D300 features a new 51-point autofocus system with Nikon&amp;#39;s 3D Focus Tracking feature and two new LiveView shooting modes that allow users to frame a photograph using the camera&amp;#39;s high-resolution LCD monitor. The D300 shares a similar Scene Recognition System as is found in the D3; it promises to greatly enhance the accuracy of autofocus, autoexposure, and auto white balance by recognizing the subject or scene being photographed and applying this information to the calculations for the three functions.&lt;br \/&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;br \/&gt;\r\n\t\tThe D300 reacts with lightning speed, powering up in a mere 0.13 seconds and shooting with an imperceptible 45-millisecond shutter release lag time. The D300 is capable of shooting at a rapid six frames per second and can go as fast as eight frames per second when using the optional MB-D10 multi-power battery pack. In continuous bursts, the D300 can shoot up to 100 shots at full 12.3-megapixel resolution. (NORMAL-LARGE image setting, using a SanDisk Extreme IV 1GB CompactFlash card.)&lt;br \/&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;br \/&gt;\r\n\t\tThe D300 incorporates a range of innovative technologies and features that will significantly improve the accuracy, control, and performance photographers can get from their equipment. Its new Scene Recognition System advances the use of Nikon&amp;#39;s acclaimed 1,005-segment sensor to recognize colors and light patterns that help the camera determine the subject and the type of scene being photographed before a picture is taken. This information is used to improve the accuracy of autofocus, autoexposure, and auto white balance functions in the D300. For example, the camera can track moving subjects better and by identifying them, it can also automatically select focus points faster and with greater accuracy. It can also analyze highlights and more accurately determine exposure, as well as infer light sources to deliver more accurate white balance detection.&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n&lt;!-- cpt_container_end --&gt;","meta_title":"ASUS ZenPad 3S","meta_description":"","meta_keyword":"","tag":"","model":"Digital","sku":"","upc":"","ean":"","jan":"","isbn":"","mpn":"","location":"","quantity":"9998","stock_status":"In Stock","image":"catalog\/product\/9.jpg","manufacturer_id":null,"manufacturer":null,"price":"80.0000","special":null,"reward":null,"points":"0","tax_class_id":"9","date_available":"2009-02-03","weight":"0.00000000","weight_class_id":"1","length":"0.00000000","width":"0.00000000","height":"0.00000000","length_class_id":"3","subtract":"1","rating":2,"reviews":"1","minimum":"1","sort_order":"0","status":"1","date_added":"2017-05-08 15:49:48","date_modified":"2017-05-30 22:00:06","viewed":"1"},"63":{"product_id":"63","name":"Microsoft Surface Pro 3","description":"&lt;div&gt;\r\n\tMacBook Air is ultrathin, ultraportable, and ultra unlike anything else.
